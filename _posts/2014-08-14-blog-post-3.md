When I joined the Economics program at USF, I hoped to study how economic policy can shape human well-being in concrete and lasting ways. This summer, I had the opportunity to see these questions up close during two field research trips in rural China, both with Stanford’s Rural Education Action Program at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies (FSI).
My focus was early childhood development (ECD): a topic deeply linked to later human capital formation and long-term economic growth. Strong foundations in health, nutrition, and stimulation during the early years are vital for children’s cognitive and social development. For countries like China, where policymakers aim to escape the middle-income trap and sustain growth, ensuring robust ECD is not just a family-level concern but also a national development priority.

Caregiver Mental Health and Early Childhood Development
======
The first project I joined was a mixed-methods study that combined quantitative analysis with in-depth qualitative fieldwork. I served as one of the trip organizers, handling logistics such as hotels and travel, but also took on an academic leadership role. Specifically, I led the research group focusing on caregiver mental health in Zhejiang province.
We designed interview guides and conducted 40 caregiver interviews, each lasting between 30 and 60 minutes. These conversations explored how caregivers perceive child development, their own mental health, and the pressures they face in daily life. Alongside this, our team analyzed baseline quantitative data previously collected in the field. Together, these efforts produced two manuscripts that are currently under review at academic journals.
Through these interviews, I gained a stronger sense of the subtle inequalities that shape early development, not only material gaps, but also differences in perceptions and priorities. Families in rural areas often have different understandings of the importance of ECD compared to urban families. Observing this gave me a more nuanced appreciation of how cultural context and lived experiences shape developmental outcomes.
Another major takeaway for me was in communication skills. Discussing sensitive issues like mental health was not always easy; many caregivers were reluctant to open up. Over time, I learned how to build trust, listen attentively, and create space for them to share their thoughts in their own words.

Supervising an RCT Endline Survey
======
The second project was the endline survey of a randomized controlled trial (RCT), also in Zhejiang. This time, I worked as a supervisor, leading a team of six researchers. We were assigned to two prefectures and tasked with surveying around 100 families.
Our work involved two parts: structured surveys with caregivers, and Bayley tests with children. The process was not without challenges. Some families, wary of outsiders, refused to participate or felt the surveys were too time-consuming. At one point, we were even asked to leave.
Yet, through collaboration with local doctors and officials, we gradually gained families’ trust and were able to complete most of the surveys. This experience underscored the importance of local partnerships in field research and the need for patience and adaptability when unexpected difficulties arise.

Lessons Beyond the Data
======
Both projects taught me lessons that go beyond the technical side of research.
* Professional growth: I learned how to manage a team, adapt to local contexts, and keep research on track even under unpredictable conditions. Supervising six people in the RCT survey gave me firsthand experience in leadership and problem-solving.
* Personal growth: Perhaps most importantly, I walked away with a deeper understanding of the lives of rural families. These interactions were not just data points: they were conversations about hopes, anxieties, and the everyday struggles of raising children.
And there were lighter moments too: traveling through seven cities, meeting children during home visits, and even hiking to see the famous Yunhe terraced fields. These experiences reminded me that research is not only about collecting information, but also about forming connections with people and places.

Looking Forward
======
These field experiences confirmed for me that research in development economics is as much about people as it is about numbers. Understanding the social and cultural environments in which data is embedded is crucial for making meaningful policy recommendations.
The lessons I learned will shape my future research. I plan to continue working on issues of human capital formation in China, connecting micro-level realities like family caregiving to broader questions of economic growth and inequality.
For future scholars planning to conduct fieldwork, my advice is simple:
* Be adaptable. Plans will change, sometimes hourly...
* Build trust. Relationships with participants and local partners matter as much as survey instruments.
* Take care of yourself. Fieldwork is both intellectually demanding and emotionally intense; finding balance is key.
Above all, embrace the experience fully. Fieldwork is not only about advancing your research, but also about discovering yourself as a scholar and a person.
