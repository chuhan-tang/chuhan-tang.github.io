My name is Chuhan (Jerry) Tang, and I am a Research Assistant at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies at Stanford University. I work on topics related to human capital, rural education, and intervention scale-ups.

My research interests lie at the intersection of development economics, political economy, and law and economics. Previously, I have worked on projects examining collective action, information control, and political trust. I have also contributed to three field experiments, participating in research design, data collection, and analysis, as well as projects using non-experimental and textual data.

I graduated summa cum laude from the University of San Francisco with a B.S. in Economics and minors in Mathematics and Legal Studies.
