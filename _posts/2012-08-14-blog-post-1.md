I visited the June 8 Internationalization and Sustainable Development of Private/Family Enterprises conference, which was co-hosted by the Asia-Pacific Chapter of the Academy of International Business, Wenzhou-Kean University, East China University of Science and Technology, and the University of San Francisco. The conference took place at the vibrant Wenzhou-Kean University campus, with early summer sun and fresh leaves breaking out to echo the significance and vitality of the discussions within. The conference included Chinese and American policymakers, scholars, and entrepreneurs for an exchange of views regarding how Chinese private firms can innovate and weather the drastically shifting tides of globalization.

Academic Discussions
======
The sessions throughout the day were structured into five broad themes, and each of these provided intellectual insight as well as practical advice. The first session, on China–U.S. trade, gave a blunt analysis of where things stood. While acknowledging the disruptions and losses associated with tariffs, some speakers did identify gains: some nations, especially in ASEAN, have seen new opportunities. Dr. Xiaohua Yang emphasized that firms must know how to spread around the world rather than depending too much on a single market, especially in the current uncertain setting. Dr. Zhaofan Tang explained that although the majority of countries are technically open to Chinese investment, U.S. federal restrictions related to national security could prove to be a significant barrier. Jennifer Zhou highlighted that American businesses overall were opposed to the trade war, citing California Governor Gavin Newsom's lawsuits against federal tariff policy. Eric Zheng reminded the audience that resilience is supply and market chain-dependent, and that the "China+1" strategy could be applied in order to decrease risk. One expert added nuance to the discussion, opposing the term “trade war” as they think we have not yet reached such a serious level. Instead, they frame it as a "tariff war" and lay out China's asymmetric negotiation strategy in response to pressure from the United States.
The second issue, AI commercialization, spoke about real cases in topics such as smart manufacturing, construction of buildings, and borderless online purchases. These cases showcased both the promise of AI and hindrances to wider use, covering from technical challenges to ethical issues. Speakers underscored that innovation must be propelled by guidelines balancing efficiency with accountability.
Succession within the family business was the subject of the third theme. Comparative Chinese and German insights were provided by Dr. Chen Ling and Dr. Tang, followed by a heart-wrenching exchange between two young entrepreneurs grappling with the double challenge of assuming leadership and fulfilling their own entrepreneurial aspirations. Their openness evoked powerful discussions throughout the audience on matters of governance and intergenerational planning.
Legacy industries in the digital age was the subject of the fourth theme. Kangnai Group's digital transformation journey was a story full of depth, demonstrating how legacy manufacturers could reinvent themselves for the global stage. Talks ranged from AI-manufacturing lines to globalization of brands, emphasizing flexibility and forward thinking.
The final topic was sustainable development. Here, the dialogue turned towards collaborative models that are intertwined with smart manufacturing, cross-border e-commerce, and education. The approaches aim to construct globally-focused talent and further strengthen the bridge between practice and research. Local Wenzhou entrepreneurs provided a perspective based on practical experiences, outlining their own internationalization problems, success, and challenges, which evoked thought-provoking discussion with academics and policymakers as well.

Cultural Experience
======
Outside of the convention center, the trip also gave a glimpse into Wenzhou industrial and cultural life. A visit to Kangnai's shoe factory revealed an applaudable level of automation and productivity and supported much that had been discussed earlier. Between sessions, I enjoyed local favorites such as huntun, fish balls, fish cakes, and rouyan, adding a more relaxed and “human” dimension to the program.
The conference was not merely an exchange of intellect: it was a meeting of perspectives shaped in different markets, policies, and realities. Through the combination of strategic thinking and grounded case studies, it provided significant intellectual and practical tools for navigating through the uncertainties of international trade and business expansion. To Wenzhou's private firms, and to a great many others across China, the ideas herein may help lay the path toward growth in a new and somewhat hopeful world.
